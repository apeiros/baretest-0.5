  # @since  0.5.0
  # @topic  Status, Test
  #
  # The status of a Phase, Test, Suite or Run
  # In case of a failure, it also contains the failure reason and the context
  # where the failure happened (@see BareTest::Phase).
  # In case of an exception, it additionally contains the exception object.
  #
  # Possible states are hierarchical:
  #
  # * Unrun
  #   The entity has not been considered for running. This can be due to
  #   selectors, tags etc.
  # * Run
  #   The entity has been run
  #   * Success
  #     The entity did run as expected.
  #     Associated with black on green in standard output.
  #   * Abort
  #     The entity could not be run or did not run as expected
  #     * Exception
  #       The code raised a (by the test) unhandled exception
  #       Associated with yellow on black in standard output.
  #     * Failure
  #       The actual outcome of the test different from the expected outcome
  #       Associated with black on red in standard output.
  #   * Skipped
  #     The test was not executed
  #     Associated with black on yellow in standard output.
  #     * Pending
  #       It was not implemented or explicitly marked as pending
  #     * MissingLibrary
  #       A library this entity declared as requirement could not be loaded
  #     * MissingComponent
  #       A baretest component this entity depends on could not be loaded
  #     * MissingDependency
  #       A specified dependency on another entitys success was not met
  #
  # The mapping of those hierarchical states to codes is as follows:
  # * Unrun: is not mapped
  # * Success:     :success
  # * Exception:   :exception
  # * Failure:     :failure
  # * Skipped:     :skipped
  #
  # The states' prevalence is: exception, failure, skipped, success.
